# SmoothBrain

Version 0.2.0

SmoothBrain is an Anki plugin that gets your highlights from [Readwise][readwise]
and generates flashcards for them using [OpenAI's GPT API][openai].

## Setup

This plugin doesn't yet have a version on the Anki plugin server, so installation
needs to be completed manually.

1. Place the all files from this repository in a `smoothbrain` subfolder in your [Anki addons folder][anki_addons_folder].
2. Launch or restart Anki.
3. Go to the `Tools` menu at the top, then click `Add-ons`.
4. Find the entry for `smoothbrain`, select it, and click the `Config` button.
5. Get a [Readwise API key][readwise_api_key].
6. Get a [OpenAI API key][openai_api_key].
7. Enter your API keys in the config and click `OK`.
8. Restart Anki. <!-- TODO: test if I can bypass this by using a function to get the config -->

## Usage

1. Go to the `Tools` menu at the top and click `Sync Readwise`, or hit `CMD+R` on Mac (or `CTRL+R` on Windows or Linux).
2. Wait for a while... the UI freezing up with large collections is a known bug.
3. Review the cards! Suspend any that aren't good. In the future I'll set up a way to send me good/bad flashcards so I can fine-tune the model.
